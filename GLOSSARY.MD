# OpenSCD Glossary

This is an opinionated glossary of terms developed by the OpenSCD community. Please note that terms specific to the SCL (Substation Configuration Language) fall outside the scope of this glossary, as they are thoroughly covered and explained by the relevant standards.

## Wizard
A wizard is a user-friendly interface that assists individuals in completing complicated tasks by breaking them into simpler, easy-to-follow steps. It typically offers guidance, instructions, and choices, making tasks more manageable and enabling users to accomplish them efficiently.

## Plug-in
A plug-in is a software module that enhances an already existing application or system by adding particular features or tools. It's crafted to seamlessly merge with the main software, broadening its capabilities without altering its fundamental structure.

## Distribution
In software development, distribution is the process of preparing a software application or tool for delivery to end-users. It involves packaging the software in a way that makes it easy to install or use on different platforms or systems. This step ensures the software reaches its intended audience and can be readily deployed for use.

## Validator plug-in
This plug-in is specifically crafted to verify or validate input, data, or code based on predefined rules or standards. Its primary role is to ensure that the information provided meets certain criteria or requirements. In the context of our tool, this plug-in is essential for validating the IEC 61850 SCL file that's either created or modified by the tool. It acts as a quality checker, ensuring the integrity and compliance of the SCL file according to specified guidelines or standards.

## Menu plug-in
Menu Plug-in in OpenSCD refers to the functionalities accessible directly from the main menu of the tool. These options perform specific tasks within the tool without necessarily adding a new module or plug-in to the workspace. For instance:

- **Save Project:** Saves the current project.
- **Open Project:** Opens an existing project.
- **Create Virtual IED:** Adds a new IED (Intelligent Electronic Device).

These options facilitate essential tasks within OpenSCD without altering the tool's interface or adding new components to the workspace.


## Editor plug-in
**Editor Plug-ins** in OpenSCD are accessed through the Extensions section in the Menu. These plug-ins, found in the Editor tab of the Extensions section, are responsible for adding or removing modules within the tool's workspace. For instance: **IED**, **Substation** and **Single Line Diagram** plug-ins.

Editor Plug-ins extend the functionality of OpenSCD by adding modules or components to the workspace, providing users with additional tools and features for more specialized tasks or configurations.
