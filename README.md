Make sure your web browser has enough free memory! If needed, disable plug-ins and close unused browser tabs.

## Installation

In order to install OpenSCD on your local device (only for you), simply visit [openscd.github.io](https://openscd.github.io), click the "Install OpenSCD" button in your address bar (Chrome or Edge on desktop) or click the "Add OpenSCD to home screen" notification in any mobile browser.

In order to install your own instance of OpenSCD on your own webserver (e.g. on your company intranet), simply download [our latest release](https://github.com/openscd/open-scd/releases/latest) (`open-scd.zip` or `open-scd.tar.gz`) and extract the archive contents into the "webroot" directory of your web server.

If you don't have your own webserver but still want your own version of OpenSCD hosted locally (e.g. on a system without an internet connection), you can [use a browser plugin that acts as a local webserver](https://github.com/openscd/open-scd/wiki/Install-OpenSCD#offline) (only for you) instead.
