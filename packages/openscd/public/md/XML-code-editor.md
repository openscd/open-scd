With **OpenSCD** elements are manipulated with so-called wizard pages. If such a page has not been created yet for an element you want to manipulate or you just are curious how this element looks like in the XML we have added a **pro mode** that you can select in **Settings**

1. Open **Menu**
2. Click on **Setting**
3. Click on switch **pro mode**



Once this is done you can open any wizard page e.g. **Edit Substation**. You can see a toggle button on the upper right corner. If you click this toggle button the wizard page disappears and the XML code editor appear containing the element in raw XML.

> NOTE: This is a feature for experienced users. You can also use this feature to change SCL content. Behind the scenes the element will be exchanged completely with the updated version. Of course you can undo anytime.
