The so-called substation section does have two variants of element. The first one we will refer to as process type elements or process structure that allow to create the physically visible structure in the substation. This process structure consists of the elements:

- [Substation](https://github.com/openscd/open-scd/wiki/Substation)
- [Voltage Level](https://github.com/openscd/open-scd/wiki/Voltage-Level)
- [Bay](https://github.com/openscd/open-scd/wiki/Bay)
- [Conducting Equipment](https://github.com/openscd/open-scd/wiki/Conducting-Equipment)
- `General Equipment` (not yet implemented)
- [Conducting Equipment](https://github.com/openscd/open-scd/wiki/Power-Transformer)
- `Transformer Winding` (not yet implemented)
- `Neutral Winding` (not yet implemented)
- `Line` (not yet implemented)
- `Process` (not yet implemented)

the other type of elements we call function type elements or functional structure that consist of the following elements:

- [Function](https://github.com/openscd/open-scd/wiki/Function)
- [SubFunction](https://github.com/openscd/open-scd/wiki/Function)
- [EqFunction](https://github.com/openscd/open-scd/wiki/Function)
- [EqSubFunction](https://github.com/openscd/open-scd/wiki/Function)
