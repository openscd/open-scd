OpenSCD uses extensions to provide built-in functionality and to allow additional functionality beyond the OpenSCD defaults.

Utilities, IED manufacturers, system integrators or other parties can create extensions and provide an interface for viewing or modifying SCL (including modification of private namespaces).

There are three types of extensions:

1. _Menu_ extensions - shown on the project menu after enabling them.
2. _Editor_ extensions - shown in the main window after enabling them.
3. _Validator_ extensions - ensure file compliance with a schema or design rules.

To enable extensions, open the project menu by clicking on the top three lines in the top left, scrolling to the bottom and selecting the _Extensions_ item. 
Then select and deselect functionality. 
If you are confident in the source of a custom extension, you can also add an extension from a URL.

> NOTE: Infrequently used or in-development extensions are disabled by default.

> NOTE: Where there are many editor extensions, scroll through them by using Shift + Wheel Mouse button.
