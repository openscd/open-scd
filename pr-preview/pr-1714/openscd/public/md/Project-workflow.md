This page is related to topics concerning project workflow within  **OpenSCD**. One of the basic goals of **OpenSCD** is to save the information in the project exclusivity to SCL files and while doing so to avoid `private` elements where possible. To be more precise we try to avoid to put information to namespaces that are not defined by the standard. This shall ensure the likelihood for interoperability in multi vendor projects. Avoiding `private` element does not mean that OpenSCD removes any. In fact for the time being OpenSCD just ignores private section.

As all information in **OpenSCD** are saved to SCL files and not some proprietary file formats a project is equal to a SCL file.
