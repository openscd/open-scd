# 1. Record architecture decisions

Date: 2023-07

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to record the architectural decisions made on this project.

## Decision

We will follow the decisions recorded in the central organizational 
repository ([.github](https://github.com/openscd/.github)), 
and record new repo-specific decisions in this repository.

We write ADRs in the `docs` folder instead of a standard `doc`, 
because `doc` is used for the generated documentation.

## Consequences

- It will be harder to track which decisions have to be taken into consideration
- Local decisions will be easier to find
