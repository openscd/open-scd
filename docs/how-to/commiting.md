# üìù Commit Message Guidelines

## Purpose

To maintain a clean, readable, and automated commit history, we enforce the [Conventional Commits ‚Üó](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification across this repository.

All commits **must** follow the format described below. Commits that do not comply will be automatically rejected by our Git hooks.

---

## üìã Commit Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
```

- `type`: the kind of change you're committing.
- `scope`: the specific part of the codebase affected (optional but encouraged).
- `subject`: a brief description of the change.

---
## ‚úèÔ∏è Examples

Good examples:
```
feat(core): add authentication module
fix(openSCD): resolve login redirect bug
docs: update contributing guidelines
chore: update eslint config
```

Bad examples (these would be rejected):
```
"fix bug"
"updated stuff"
"small changes"
```

## üß† Additional Notes

- The commit hook will automatically validate your message.
- If your commit is rejected, edit your message and try again.
- For complex changes, you can add a longer body after the subject, separated by a blank line.

Example:
```
feat(core): support new user roles

This adds support for multiple user role types in the core module. Also refactors the existing permission system to be more scalable.
```
