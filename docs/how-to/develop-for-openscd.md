# How To Develop for OpenSCD

There are multiple ways you can develop for the OpenSCD Platforms

- _menu plugins_ live in the menu and can provide functionality such as opening local files or from a server
- _editor plugins_ are used to edit a big portion or even the whole of an SCL file
- _validators_ are here to validate changes from simple XML validation to complex business logic
- _wizard plugins_ are similar to editor plugins but usually focus on a specific element and are available globally
