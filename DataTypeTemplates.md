All top-down projects start here. You can define your data model in a green field approach with the `Template` editor of OpenSCD.

There are two different ways how you can do this with OpenSCD

1. [Start from scratch](https://github.com/openscd/open-scd/wiki/StartFromScratch)
2. [Start with OpenSCD templates](https://github.com/openscd/open-scd/wiki/StartFromTemplate)

In addition to that you can read/manipulate any element and their attributes using the wizards for

- [DOType](https://github.com/openscd/open-scd/wiki/DOType)
- [DAType](https://github.com/openscd/open-scd/wiki/DAType)
