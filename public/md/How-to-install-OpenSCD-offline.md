OpenSCD can be installed on computers with no World Wide Web connection. There are two approaches to do that.

***

1. You still have access to a local network (intranet):
Ask your IT colleagues and ask them to configure a web server in the intranet and load the version you want to e.g. [version 0.2.0](https://github.com/openscd/open-scd/releases/tag/v0.2.0) -> `open-scd.zip`

***


2. You have no access to any network:
You have to install a software that allows you to run a web server locally on your machine e.g [Web Server for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb)
For `Web Server for Chrome`
* Download a [version](https://github.com/openscd/open-scd/releases) of OpenSCD. To be more precise, the `open-scd.zip`.
* Extract `open-scd.zip`
* Start the web server 
* Click on `CHOOSE FOLDER`
* Navigate to the extracted `open-scd` folder (You see folders .git, doc, public and other).
* Click on the web server URL within `Web Server for Chrome`
