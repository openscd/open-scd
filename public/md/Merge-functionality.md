Merge is a basic functionality that allows to import information from other files or to update existing elements with information from other files. When merging three different scenarios can occur.

1. Add: An element is present in the existing file but not in imported file (delete icon)
2. Delete: An element is missing in the existing file but not in the imported file (edit icon)
3. Merge: An element in the existing file and the imported file are equal but have children with differences. (merge icon)

In OpenSCD you can merge two files together. The merge is a step by step procedure where the software guide you through the process. It starts with children of the SCL root element moving deeper with each step.
