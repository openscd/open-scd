A `ClientLN` is one of 3 elements that are describing connections between IEDs in a SCL file. 

### HowTo connect Report with ClientLNs
OpenSCD allows you to connect `ReportControl` via `ClientLN`. The starting point is the **IED** in the **Substation editor**.

> NOTE: When `ClientLN` connections are already present in the `Report Control` block the wizard does not close in **CONNECT**

> NOTE: If the `EnableRpt` `max` attribute is smaller or equal to the `ClientLN` a connection is not possible. The `ReportControl` on the rigth hand side is disabled.

> TIP: You can filter for several terms at same time. The space between terms is acting as a logical AND.
